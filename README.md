# Lora SX1272 test code

This repo contains test code for Lora SX1272 radios connected to Raspberry Pis.

## Hardware Requirements

* 2 x Raspberry Pi 2 Mode B
* 2 x Raspberry Pi to Arduino shields connection bridge
* 2 x LoRa Module SX1272 (868/900MHz) 

## Compile software

### Clone repo both Raspberry Pis

    git clone https://github.com/mngiess/lora-sx1272-test.git

### Compile arduiPi library for Raspberry Pi 2.0

    cd raspberrypi_2.0
    ./compile_rpi2
    cd ..

### Compile SX1272 driver

    g++ -I./raspberrypi_2.0/ardupi2.0 -c SX1272.cpp -o SX1272.o
    
### Compile transmitter application

    g++ -I./raspberrypi_2.0/ardupi2.0 -lpthread -lrt transmitter.cpp SX1272.o ./raspberrypi_2.0/ardupi2.0/arduPi.o -o transmitter
    
### Compile receiver application

    g++ -I./raspberrypi_2.0/ardupi2.0 -lpthread -lrt receiver.cpp SX1272.o ./raspberrypi_2.0/ardupi2.0/arduPi.o -o receiver
  
  
## Running it

### First Raspberry Pi run the receiver

    ./receiver
    
### Second Raspberry Pi the the transmitter

    ./transmitter
    
### Sample log transmitter
